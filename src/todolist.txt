Things to do for this game:


Change around images to use imagedata class
set up tiles to work correctly
set up networking

then after that it's pretty much set. Do I care if the client doesn't know how much longer for the tile to grow? Probably not.

Once there's that done, I can work on animals and rooms and day/night cycles.
And full multiplayer instead of fake multiplayer.
