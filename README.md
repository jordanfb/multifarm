# multifarm
A networked multiplayer farming game along the lines of Stardew Valley and Factorio.

(Or that's what it would be if I had finished it more)
Instead it's a demo of wandering around procedurally generated terrain using a (pretty cool in my opinion) chunk loading and image caching system.
